# Eat Da Burger

## About

This project makes use of Node.js and Express.js to create a full stack web application. The app includes front-end client side code (html, css, javascript/jquery) and back-end server side code (node.js and express.js npm libraries/packages). The final version of the app is deployed through Heroku. The app is a simple website allowing the user to create burgers and devour them as they please. The user also has the option to delete burgers which will completely remove them from the database. The app utilizes JawsDB to use a MySQL database alongside heroku for deployment. The app was built with a robust server design in mind, with multiple javascript files and folder directories to handle different server tasks that all communicate with each other in unison to keep the different functions separated and neatly organized.
